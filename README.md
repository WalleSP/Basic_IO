## Branches

### Upstream Main

#### Issue based
    * Create issues in the repository (example below)
        - create a new issue in the github repository and assign it to yourself or another team member
            - Name the branch the same as the name of the issue, then implement and merge to main when all changes are implemented
        

#### Upstream dev branches
    * Each team member has their own branch (typically named: dev, dev1, dev2) etc

```sh
git branch dev
git checkout dev
```
